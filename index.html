                I love to bake and cook Filipino sweet delicacies as a matter of fact I am an NCII holder in breads and pastry.<br>
                During pandemic,I've been selling different kinds of foods such as<br>
                leche flan,kutsinta,puto,yema cake,maja and I named my small business <b>"MAE'S SWEET STUFF"</b><br>
                I also started an online page named <b>"MAE'S ONLINE SHOP"</b> and I am posting different kinds of items<br>
                like clothes,make ups,household items and appliances.<br>
                These are my source of income during pandemic era,with hard work and perseverance<br>
                I was able to survive and be stable until I am eligible to start working.
